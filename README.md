# Search'in
## UPDATE Aug 28 2018
I've sent a request to Microsoft Store to add my extension. So there are chances it will be available in Store soon and will work in your browser all the time (without confirmation on each start up)

---

This is an extension for Microsoft Edge browser. Extension adds context menu item when there is selected text on the page and provides an ability to search this text with search engine.

#### Features
- right-click (context menu) item in browser
- search selected text in choosen search engine (selection in links supported too)
- 3 default search engines: Google, Bing, Yandex
- add your own url of the search engine (see options page)
- detect URL in selection and adds context menu "Go to: ..." with provides navigation to selected URL

For now that's all. But while Edge lacks the search via right-click I hope it helps.

For feature request create an issue and it will be reviewed and processed ;)
