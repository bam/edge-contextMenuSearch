# edge-contextMenuSearch
## UPDATE 10 April '18
_In Microsoft Edge 41.16299.248.0 there is native support for Search with Google context menu. So anyone who updates the windows 10 is able now to use this feature without any extension. Thus I decided to put aside this project and don't plan to develop it actively.
If you need a help with this extension or can't use native feature of search, let me know and I will try to help you with my extension and maybe fix known bugs._

This is an extension for Microsoft Edge browser. Extension adds context menu item when there is selected text on the page and provides an ability to search this text with search engine.
#### Features
- right-click (context menu) item in browser
- search selected text in choosen search engine (selection in links supported too)
- 3 default search engines: Google, Bing, Yandex
- add your own url of the search engine (see options page)
- detect URL in selection and adds context menu "Go to: ..." with provides navigation to selected URL

For now that's all. But while Edge lacks the search via right-click I hope it helps.

For feature request create an issue and it will be reviewed and processed ;)
